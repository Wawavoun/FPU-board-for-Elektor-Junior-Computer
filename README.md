# FPU-board-for-Elektor-Junior-Computer

This is some information about a FPU board I made for my Elektor Junior Computer.

This board is based on a AMD AM9511 or Intel C8231 running at 2 or 4 MHz.

The design is inspired from the Microcrunch (Micro number 39 and 40, 08/1981 and 09/1981) from John Hart.
The magazines are including here, hoping there is no copyright problem. I case of just leave a message and I will remove them.

The gerber files are avaiable.

At that time no software have been writed for handy usage.
If you have idea and have knowledge on that topics take contact please. 

Schematic have been made by hand, paper, pencil and eraser so be comprehensive...
